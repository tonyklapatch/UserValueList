# UserValueList

UserValueList is a wishlist/favorites/remember tool for MODX Revolution, which will give users the opportunity to save resources or other objects. 
 
UserValueList allows you to keep different lists (simply assign different keys) in the user's extended field or in a cookie.

UserValueList was originally developed in January 2012 by "ScherpOntwikkeling": http://www.scherpontwikkeling.nl for "Mark Hamstra": http://www.markhamstra.com. This copy has been modified by Tony Klapatch.
